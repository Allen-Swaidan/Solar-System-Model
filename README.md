# Solar-System-Model
A basic model of a prism rotating in the center with 2 cubes orbiting around each other while rotating around the prism. All code is written in C++ using OpenGL and GLSL. My plan is to now create spheres to model the entire solar system and incorporate a spacetime fabric that will have a curvature in the presence of these masses in accordance to Einstiens General Theory of Relativity.
